#Data Cleaning: Use Python and the isolation forest model to find outliers. Replace the outlier with the N\A value, then use a neural network to get the predicted value and replace the N\A value by using Keras, TensorFlow, and Python. And the average MSE that a lower value means higher accuracy for all outliers is around 0.25.
